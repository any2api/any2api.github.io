title: SOAP API Generator Available
---

REST is probably the most popular kind of API in the modern Web. It naturally fits the Web's architecture and effectively utilizes HTTP as the Web's native protocol. Therefore, we originally built the any2api [REST API generator](https://github.com/any2api/any2api-generator-rest) to produce containerized REST APIs for existing executables. However, in certain environments other kinds of APIs (e.g., SOAP/WSDL in the fields of e-science and enterprise application integration) seem to be more appropriate. The any2api framework can produce any kind of API for a given executable and is not bound to REST at all. The newly available [SOAP/WSDL API generator](https://github.com/any2api/any2api-generator-soap) can be used to generate containerized SOAP APIs. More generators are on their way.
